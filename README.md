Step-by-Step Workflow

1. Data Collection

* data_collection.py
Scrapes Yahoo Finance for financial news. Extracts:
  * Title
  * Tickers mentioned
  * Source of the article
  * Article link
  * Time of publication
Saves results in Articles.json and/or news_title.json.

2. Data Preparation

* news_title.json
Contains structured and cleaned news data as a list of dictionaries, ready for analysis.
* Top Tickers Extraction
In eda_visualization.py, tickers mentioned in the news are counted using Pythonâ€™s Counter to identify the most frequently mentioned stocks.
* Stock Price Data Download
Using the yfinance library, historical stock price data for the top tickers is downloaded (last 7 days) and saved in stock_data.csv.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

* eda_visualization.py
Performs EDA using pandas and matplotlib:
  * Loads stock data and top tickers
  * Plots closing prices of top mentioned stocks over time
  * Plots daily trading volume for these stocks
  * (Optional: Overlay news events for advanced analysis)

## Key code steps:

### Find top 3 tickers by news mentions

### Plot Closing Prices

### Plot Trading Volume
